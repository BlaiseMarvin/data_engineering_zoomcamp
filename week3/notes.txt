Data Warehouses

OLAP v. OLTP

OLTP - Online Transaction Processing
OLAP - Online Analytical Processing

What is a data warehouse?
 - OLAP solution
 - Used for reporting and data analysis

Data Warehouse:
 - Raw data
 - Summary data
 - Data Marts

Big Query:
 - Serveless Data Warehouse
   - No servers to manage or database software to install
- Software as well as infrastructure including:
 - scalability and high availability
- Built-in features like:
  - machine learning
  - geospatial analysis
  - business intelligence
- BigQuery maximizes flexibility by separating the compute engine that analyses your data from your storage



BigQuery Partition:
When you create a partition column in big query, you can choose between:
 - Time-unit column
 - Ingestion time (_PARTITIONTIME)
 - Integer range partitioning
When using Time unit or ingestion time
 - daily, hourly, monthly or yearly
number of partitions limit is 4000

BigQuery Clustering:
  - Columns you specify are used to colocate related data 
  - Order of the column is important
  - The order of the specified columns determines the sort order 
  - clustering improves
    - filter queries
    - aggregate queries

Build ML model in your serveless BQ data warehouse
Export model's resources to gcs bucket
bq --project_id total-fiber-448420-g2 extract -m ny_taxi.tip_model gs://my_taxi_ml_model/tip_model

then copy the model's files from gcs to your local directory:
 - gsutil cp -r gs://my_taxi_ml_model/tip_model ./model/

Create a serving directory 
 - copy all our files to the serving directory
