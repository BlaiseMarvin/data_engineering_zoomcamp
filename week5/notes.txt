Batch Processing:
 - Processing Data 
    - Batch and Streaming
      
Apache Spark:
    - Data Processing Engine
        Its distributed - can have a cluster with a couple of nodes 

        When to use spark:
            - 
            - DATA LAKE => (SPARK PROCESSING ENGINE) => DATA LAKE 
              
              SOMETIMES THOUGH, YOUR PROCESSING JOB CAN BE EXPRESSED IN NATIVE SQL AND 
              YOU CAN JUST CONNECT AN EXTERNAL TABLE TO YOUR WAREHOUSE AND DO THE PROCESSING YOU NEED 

              BUT, SOME JOBS CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN NATIVE SQL, SO YOU'D NEED SPARK 
              E.G. MACHINE LEARNING JOBS

              ALTERNATIVES TO SPARK ARE APACHE HIVE, PRESTO/ATHENA

            - TYPICAL WORKFLOW
                - 
                - RAW DATA => DATA LAKE => (TRANSFORMATIONS WITH SQL) => SPARK (PROCESSING) => PYTHON JOB FOR TRAINING A ML MODEL

                  - CAN ALSO TAKE MODEL AND THEN USE SPARK TO APPLY THE MODEL ON DATA TO GENERATE MORE DATA
