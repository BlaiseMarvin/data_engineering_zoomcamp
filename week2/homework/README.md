### WEEK 2 HOMEWORK: DATA INGESTION
***
In this section - using airflow - I will write a pipeline to ingest all the 2021 data files from the [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases) repository. Specifically all the 2021 data on green and yellow trips - then insert this in both a postgres database and also upload parquet files to GCS and an external table to reference all of them.
