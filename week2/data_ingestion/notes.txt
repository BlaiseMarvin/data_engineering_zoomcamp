ELT vs ETL
Export Load and Transform vs Export Transform and Load
Export transform and load - small amounts of data => this is a schema on write solution - well defined schema then write the data
ELT => Large amounts of data - where we write the data first and then determine the schema on read 
ELT provides data lake support - schema on read

Gotcha of Data Lake
Converting into Data Swamp
No versioning
Incompatible schemas for same data without versioning
No metadata associated
Joins not possible

Cloud provider for data lake
GCP -cloud storage
AWS - S3
Azure - Azure Blob


Workflow Orchestration
DAGS are the workflows

Data Pipeline => 
DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph
Directed
Acyclic - no cycles

DAGS have some parameters 
How do we run the graph => Need to have an easy way of running things

Apache Airflow
Airflow consists of a web server
Scheduler - component responsible for scheduling jobs
Worker - component that executes a task given to it by the scheduler
Metadata Database - stores the state of the environment - used by the scheduler and worker
Error service -
